				<h5>Do I have to be a woman to attend?</h5>
				<p>Lehman College Women in Computer Science (WiCS) is looking to build a community where marginalized people in tech like women can feel welcomed and ready to take on an exciting challenge. To accomplish this, we need all hands on deck! As such, we do not require identification as any specific gender to attend but do encourage you to leave an opportunity open to those who may not have had this opportunity before.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h5>Who can participate?</h5>
				<p>Current students or students whom have graduated in the past year may register.</p>
